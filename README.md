## Overview

**Arta** is a simple python rules engine designed for python developers.

### Goal

There is one main reason for using **Arta** and it was the main goal of its development at *MAIF*: increase business rules maintainability.

In other words, facilitate rules handling in our python apps.

### Origins

The need of a python *rules engine* emerged when we were working on a new major release of our internal use of [Melusine](https://github.com/maif/melusine) (i.e., email qualification pipeline with ML capabilities).

We were looking for a python library to *centralize, manage and standardize* all the implemented **business rules** we had but didn't find the perfect fit. 

Therefore, we decided to create this package and by extension of the MAIF's values, we planned to share it to the community.

### Features

* Standardize the definition of a rule. All rules are defined the same way in a unique place.
* Rules are released from the code base, which is less error prone and increases clearness.
* Use **Arta** whatever your field is.
* Great combination with Machine Learning: groups all the deterministic rules of your ML projects.

### A Simple Example

Create the three following files and run the `main.py` script (`python main.py` or `python3 main.py`).

`rules.yaml` :

```yaml
---
rules:
  default_rule_set:
    admission:
      ADMITTED:
        simple_condition: input.power=="strength" or input.power=="fly"
        action: set_admission
        action_parameters:
          value: true  
      NOT_ADMITTED:
        simple_condition: null
        action: set_admission
        action_parameters:
          value: false

actions_source_modules:
  - actions
```

`actions.py` :

```python
from typing import Any


def set_admission(value: bool, **kwargs: Any) -> dict[str, bool]:
    """Return a dictionary containing the admission result."""
    return {"is_admitted": value}
```

`main.py` :

```python
from arta import RulesEngine

eng = RulesEngine(config_path=".")

data = {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Superman",
        "civilian_name": "Clark Kent",
        "age": None,
        "city": "Metropolis",
        "language": "english",
        "power": "fly",
        "favorite_meal": "Spinach",
        "secret_weakness": "Kryptonite",
        }

result = eng.apply_rules(input_data=data)

print(result)
```

You should get: `{"admission": {"is_admitted": True}}`
